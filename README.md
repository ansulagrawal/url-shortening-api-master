# URL Shortening API Landing Page - Frontend Mentor

This project is a responsive landing page for a URL shortening API, built using Redux Toolkit (RTK), React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and the Shrtcode API.




## Features

- Users can input a long URL to shorten
- Users can view a list of shortened URLs they've previously created
- Users can copy the shortened URL to their clipboard with one click
- The app checks if the same URL has already been shortened and retrieves the previously - generated short URL without calling the API again, reducing unnecessary API calls and - speeding up the user experience.
